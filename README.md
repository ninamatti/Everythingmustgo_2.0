## Future Features

In the future, I would like to turn this into a move-out marketplace application where anyone can create their own marketplace in a few simple steps that they can then send to their friends to make sure their furniture and other items finds new owners that they trust. To that end, I plan to implement the following features:

- user login and authentication
- user data storage
- image upload function
- feature that lets users add a new item they want to sell or pass on
- feature that lets guests log in and claim any items they like
- page that sums up all uploaded items and their status in the form of a list for quick reference (only editable by marketplace host)
- general page that lists all marketplaces built so far
- deploy on google app store
