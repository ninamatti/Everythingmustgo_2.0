                    We are moving back to Switzerland and have to give away almost all of our things - most of them, we would like to pass on for free to people we know so that they can enjoy them as we did! If there is an item you like, please put your name down in the corresponding Google sheet (if you were given the link to this page by us, you should have also been given the link to the google sheet). If there's already someone who has written down their name before you, please add your name to the waiting list! If you found one or several items you like, please also send us a personal message at the same time as putting your name on the list, and we can arrange details together.
                </p>
